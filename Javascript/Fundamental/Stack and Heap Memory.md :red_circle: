## Stack and Heap
Once we maniuplate javascript code, the JS engine allocates memory for this and releases it once it's not needed anymore.

All data types (static data) are allocated to **stack memory**, while Reference Type would be allocated to **heap memory** afterward

The process of memory allocation:<br>
1. Static memory allocation (for all data) > 2. Dynamic memory allocation (for references)

### Stack: Static memory allocation

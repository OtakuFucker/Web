title: Javascript and its aplication
---

## Javascript
A language serves for any device contains **Javascript engine** (initially browser) 
<br><br>
Instances of Javascript engines:
- **V8** in Google Chrome / Edge 
- **SpiderMonkey** in Firefox
<br>

Simple discription to the process of Javascript execution:
```
1) the embedded engine reads script's codes
2) converts the script to machine codes
3) run the machine codes
```

**In a nutshell, Javascript is a script to make websites alive in frontend field.** 
<br>
<br>

## Abilities and restrictions of Javascript 
#### Abilities
Manipulate the web / web server
  1) modify content and style of webpage (sync)
  2) react to user actions / events (async)
  3) send request to remote servers (async + API)
  4) get and set cookies 
  5) store and remember data on the client-side "local storage"

#### Restrictions 
1) Anything may threaten the safety and security of user's information (Same Origin Policy)
2) accessability to data contained outside of the webpage

**We need extra manipulations to lift the above restrictions**
<br>
<br>
## Javascript and language "over" it
Stylish language that would be converted to javascript before execution
```
1) the language codes are converted to javascript codes
2) the embedded engine reads script's codes
3) converts the script to machine codes
4) run the machine codes
```
Instance:
- Typescript: adding “strict data typing” to simplify the development and support of complex systems
- CoffeeScript: shorter syntax and achieve clearer and more precise code
- Dart: standalone language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser environments 

## Javascript and compatibility tables
Whether a piece of code can run depends on both the syntax and its compatibility to the browser. <br>
For instance, Some sorts of codes accepted by Google chrome maybe refused by Firefox. <br><br>
**It is a must to check the compatibility table before used the code.**
<br>
<br>
## Modern Javascript

What the following files inform about are post-ES6 specifications and manuals
